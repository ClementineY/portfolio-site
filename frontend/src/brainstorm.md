I'm Bryant! (he/him)
I build web experiences
--

I help awesome designers build their wildest dreams.
Together, we'll make something that stands out from the crowd–and has people saying, "woah."

I am a full stack web developer–and a trusted creative collaborator. I'll help you brainstorm, map the technical landscape, solution to protect your budget/timeline, & realize your vision down to the pixel.

(I'm happiest when I have a challenge.)

I have seven years of experience helping best-in-class designers build award-winning projects. I understand design systems. I dev alone and with teams. I owned whole projects from scratch, but also onboard quickly to contribute to existing work. I can effectively face and communicate with all stakeholders--leading up, down, and laterally.

(React/NextJS, Typescript, Tailwind/CSS/SCSS/PostCSS, Three.js/R3f, webGL, GLSL, Sanity, Node, socketIO, webRTC.)
(Communication, ownership, )

When I'm not writing code, I'm playing funk trombone! I've toured all over the country with artists like The Isley Brothers and I love doing storytelling livestreams with my electric trombone.

I wanna hear about what has you excited about your next project.
